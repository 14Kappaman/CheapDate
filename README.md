## Directions for Future Development
For future implementations, we would like to add other APIs to our application to create more date options in our database. For example, a combination of dinner and an event chosen from a Groupon api, or a pop up bar event combined with
a concert gathered from the Livenation api. Maybe even include an option to add ridesharing to that event.
We would also like to implement more specific search parameters to make for a much more personal user experience. 
Eventually, we would like to add mobile access to our application, creating a touch and swiping mechanism for ease of use.

We want the user able to not only choose between different date options but swipe through different personalized profiles that other frugal-minded people have created.

We want to get to a point where we can match people that have chosen similar filters on their date profiles. For example: if I want to go to a concert or an event, I can just open my app and swipe to see if anybody is interested in going
to that concert with me, and perhaps add a dinner option prior to that event without the need to open any other apps.
